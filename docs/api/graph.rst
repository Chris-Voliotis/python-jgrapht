The Graph Interface
*******************

.. currentmodule:: jgrapht

As you might expect the main interface is the :class:`Graph <jgrapht.graph.Graph>` and almost
all library methods revolve around it. This is the default graph which should be used in most
the use cases.

.. autoclass:: jgrapht.graph.Graph
   :inherited-members:
   :members:

The :class:`.GraphType` is used to represent during runtime the properties of the graph.

.. autoclass:: jgrapht.graph.GraphType
